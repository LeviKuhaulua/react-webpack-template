# Purpose 

Aloha mai kƒÅkou! <br> 

This is a simple starter template for React and Webpack. I included code comments and also have some explanations in this README.md to explain why certain things are set up this way and how they might be beneficial for you as a developer. My main goal for this template repository is to (hopefully) help you build confidence and knowledge in how to create and configure your own project without the need for a build tool like `npx create-react-app`. 

**Side Note**: If you're wondering, the MIT License allows you to use and modify the template to your liking. If you want some more info you can go to this site: [Choose a License - MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) 


## Implementations

- [React](https://react.dev/reference/react) 
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/) 
- Webpack Dev Server

# Folder Structure

*note: the order that the folders are organized may not match up but that's okay. It's more important to understand what each folder does*

<br> 

- **node_modules** - dependencies and packages installed by npm
- **public** - the folder or build that users online will see
    - **assets** - icons or images that the HTML files will use
    - **dist** - output generated by Webpack
- **src** - folder that contains all your source code
    - **assets** - assets such as videos, pictures or icons that will be used by your React components and/or pages
    - **components** - React components
    - **pages** - React pages
    - **styles** - styles for your components and pages


## Important Files

- **.gitignore** - tells Git what files to ignore pushing to your remote repository
- **LICENSE.txt** - license that tells other people what they can and can't do with your code
- **webpack.config.js** - base configuration file for Webpack
- **webpack.dev.js** - configuration file for development
- **webpack.prod.js** - configuration file for production
- **package.json and package-lock.json** - stores your npm dependencies and also helps you run scripts for your project like getting the development server on.

# Getting The Project Running

1. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install all the project dependencies
2. Start the development server by running `npm start` in the terminal
3. Make your changes and do whatchu gotta do
4. Save your changes and exit the dev server


## Production

Once you are happy with your changes and finish your project, you can run `npm run build` in your terminal to create the production build for your project. 


## Adding A New Page

1. Create your file in src/pages
    - It's important that you make sure the first letter in your file is **uppercased** so that you can render the page in your HTML file
    - It's also important that you create your root for your React file, see example below: 

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import * as React from 'react';
// import your React components and styles here

const MyPage = () => {
    return(
        <>
            {/* Put Code Here */}
        </>
    );
}

// This is the important part
const root = document.getElementById('root');
createRoot(root).render(<Index />);
```


2. In the terminal you can run `npm run build` or `npx webpack`, basically this is to generate the code bundle for your new HTML page to reference
3. In your public folder, create a new file with the name of your page, then add the HTML boiler plate code
4. In the HTML file create a `<script src=>` tag and add the path to your generated bundle. See example below: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My New Page</title>
</head>
<body> 
    <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view this website</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="dist/mynewpage.js"></script>
</body> 
</html>
```
