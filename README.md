# Purpose 

Aloha mai kƒÅkou! <br> 

This is a simple starter template for React and Webpack. I included code comments and also have some explanations in this README.md to explain why certain things are set up this way and how they might be beneficial for you as a developer. My main goal for this template repository is to (hopefully) help you build confidence and knowledge in how to create and configure your own project without the need for a build tool like `npx create-react-app`. 


## Implementations

- React 
- Webpack 
- Webpack Dev Server

Documentation: 

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/)
- [React](https://react.dev/reference/react)
